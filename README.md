# FIRESTARTER - A Processor Stress Test Utility

FIRESTARTER can be build under Linux, Windows and macOS with CMake.

GCC (>=7) or Clang (>=9) is supported.

CMake option | Description
:--- | :---
FIRESTARTER_BUILD_TYPE | Can be any of FIRESTARTER, FIRESTARTER_CUDA or FIRESTARTER_CUDA_ONLY. Default FIRESTARTER
FIRESTARTER_LINK_STATIC | Link FIRESTARTER as a static binary. Note, dlopen is not supported in static binaries. This option is not available on macOS or with CUDA enabled. Default ON
FIRESTARTER_BUILD_HWLOC | Build hwloc dependency. Default ON
FIRESTARTER_THREAD_AFFINITY | Enable FIRESTARTER to set affinity to hardware threads. Default ON

## Metrics

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER supports to collect metrics during runtime.
Available metrics can be shown with `--list-metrics`.
Default metrics are `perf-ipc`, `perf-freq`, `ipc-estimate` and `sysfs-powercap-rapl`.

### Custom metrics

If one would like to use custom metrics, e.g. an external power measurement, `--metric-from-stdin=NAME` allows metric values to be passed via stdin in the following format:
`{NAME} {TIME SINCE EPOCH IN NS} {ABSOLUT METRIC VALUE (double)}\n`.
See [here](examples/test_metric.py) for a basic example.

## Measurement

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER has the option to output the collected metric values by specifying `--measurement`.
Options `--start-delta (default 5000ms)` and `--stop-delta (default 2000ms)` specify a time in milliseconds in which metric values should be ignored.
After a run, the output will be given in CSV format to stdout.

### Example

Measure all available metrics for 15 minutes disregarding the first 5 minutes and last two seconds (default to `--stop-delta`).
```
FIRESTARTER --measurement --start-delta=300000 -t 900
```

## Optimization

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER has the option to optimize itself using evolutionary algorithms.
It currently supports the multiobjective algorithm NSGA2, selected by `--optimize=NSGA2`.

The evolutionary algorithm evaluates individuals one after another.
Each evaluation of a given individual is `-t | --timeout` seconds long.
Selecting a long enough time for letting the power consumption stabilize, but not too long as this will leed to a much longer optimization timespan.
During this time metrics are collected and the selected metrics (`--optimization-metrics`) are used for assigning a fitness. (Specify multiple times of a multiobjective algorithm.)
Using a high precision power metric is essential for good optimization results.
If you use the `sysfs-powercap-rapl` metric make sure the RAPL values of your CPU microarchitecture have a close correlation to the actual power consumption, e.g. IntelÂ® processors<sup>[1](#intel-trademark)</sup> since Haswell, see [An Energy Efficiency Feature Survey of the Intel Haswell Processor](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2015.70).

Individuals are made of different instruction groups and their ratios to one another.
Without specifying the `--run-instruction-groups` option, preselected instruction groups will be used for optimization.
Setting this option allows the user to select different instruction group, e.g. for optimizing FIRESTARTER on a not yet optimized microarchitecture.
The format of this is the same as shown by `-a | --avail` (Show all supported microarchitectures and their optimized individual.)
All available instruction groups can be listed with `--list-instruction-groups`.

The number of individuals per generation (`--individuals`), as is the number of generations (`--generation`) is set 20 per default.

Before the optimization runs a user-defined period of preheating of the CPU is carried out.
Option `--preheat` is specified to a default of 240 seconds.

After the optimization finishes the acquired data will be written to `{HOSTNAME}_${STARTTIME}.json` if not specified otherwise with the option `--optimize-outfile`.
An [IPython Notebook](examples/Evaluation_Notebook/Evaluation_Notebook.ipynb) is provided for basic visualization.

### NSGA2

The NSGA2 algorithm, as described in [A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/4235.996017), is a multiobjective algorithm allowing FIRESTARTER to optimize with two (or more) metrics.
This is relevant as the highest power consumption can be achieved by both optimizing for a high IPC (instruction per cycle) and high power consumption.
Parameters of the algorithm can be tweaked with `--nsga2-cr` and `--nsga2-m`.

### Examples

Optimize FIRESTARTER with NSGA2 and `sysfs-powercap-rapl` and `perf-ipc` metric. The duration for the evaluation of a setting is 20s long. The default instruction groups for the current platform will be used. (Show them with `-a | --avail`)
```
FIRESTARTER -t 20 --optimize=NSGA2 --optimization-metric sysfs-powercap-rapl,perf-ipc
```

If `perf-ipc` is not available use `ipc-estimate`
```
FIRESTARTER -t 20 --optimize=NSGA2 --optimization-metric sysfs-powercap-rapl,ipc-estimate
```

# FIRESTARTER - A Processor Stress Test Utility

FIRESTARTER can be build under Linux, Windows and macOS with CMake.

GCC (>=7) or Clang (>=9) is supported.

CMake option | Description
:--- | :---
FIRESTARTER_BUILD_TYPE | Can be any of FIRESTARTER, FIRESTARTER_CUDA or FIRESTARTER_CUDA_ONLY. Default FIRESTARTER
FIRESTARTER_LINK_STATIC | Link FIRESTARTER as a static binary. Note, dlopen is not supported in static binaries. This option is not available on macOS or with CUDA enabled. Default ON
FIRESTARTER_BUILD_HWLOC | Build hwloc dependency. Default ON
FIRESTARTER_THREAD_AFFINITY | Enable FIRESTARTER to set affinity to hardware threads. Default ON

## Metrics

FIRESTARTER support to collect metrics during runtime.
Available metrics can be shown with `--list-metrics`.
Default metrics are perf-ipc, perf-freq, ipc-estimate and powercap-sysfs-rapl.

### Custom metrics

If one would like to use custom metrics, e.g. an external power measurement, `--metric-from-stdin=NAME` allows metric values to be passed via stdin in the following format:
`{NAME} {TIME SINCE EPOCH IN NS} {ABSOLUT METRIC VALUE (double)}\n`.
Make sure to use flush after each line.

## Measurement

FIRESTARTER has the option to output the colleted metric values by specifying `--measurement`.
Options `--start-delta` and `--stop-delta` specify a time in milliseconds in which metric values should be ignored.
After a run the output will be given in csv format to stdout.

## Optimization

FIRESTARTER has the option to optimize itself.
It currently supports the multiobjective algorithm NSGA2, selected by `--optimize=NSGA2`.
The optimization relies on the execution of FIRESTARTER with a combination of instruction groups, specified by `--run-instruction-groups`.
Available instruction groups can be listed with `--list-instruction-groups`.
During each test run of the duration specified by `-t | --timeout` metrics will collect information about the fitness.
The used metrics for optimization can be specified by `--optimization-metrics`.
An output file with the results will be written to `{HOSTNAME}_${STARTTIME}.json` if the option `--optimize-outfile` is not given.
